# Welcome to elchemi!

*elchemi* is a software tool for generating electro-modulated wide-field images used in iontronic microscopy.

Electro-modulation (or potentiodynamic) microscopy is a given name to a class of microscopy methods in which the optical contrast is obtained by modulating the electric current passing through, or the electric potential applied to, the sample under the microscope. The control program must synchronize the imaging triggers with a multiple of the externally applied modulation frequency. This is equivalent to creating a digital lock-in to obtain the modulation contrast for the full image. 

This method can be used to investigate surface ionic currents (EDL-modulation microscopy), current transport on planar goemetries (via electrothermal modulation) or charging of electrolytes in battery material.

For an alternative implementation of this technique that uses an electronic lock-in amplifier and a point detector, please see
